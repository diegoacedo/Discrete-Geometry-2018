I studied a Degree in Mathematics in the University of CÃ¡diz. I am interested mostly in group theory, but I'm also keen on measure theory and algebraic topology, and I do not really dislike many parts of mathematics. I have not learned much geometry before, and I hope with this course I can get some ideas.
I am not sure yet about my future. After finishing this master, I plan to get some job experience, and hopefully some years later I will try to do a Ph.D.
